##  Yacila I. Deza-Araujo, PhD.

My name is Yacila. I am from Cajamarca, a lovely city in the Peruvian Andes. I completed my education as a clinical psychologist in Trujillo, Peru and  studied a master in Cognitive Neuropsychology in  Madrid, Spain.  After that, I went back to Peru and work as a psychologist, neuropsychologist and part-time in an airline at the airport (I have received already all the insults that I can stand in life). After three years, I got a scholarship from the German government to pursue a PhD in neuroscience at the Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden, Germany....and I did it! It costed me lot of sleepless nights and disappointments, but in the end it is all worth.

Here, I would like to offer you what we could not find: a clear and realistic assessment and mentoring to increase the chances of the younger generations to get high academic education. Because of our background, we offer especial support to Latinamerican students, but everyone is welcome. We can help you to tailor your motivation letter, CV and give you some tips that worked for us in our academic lives. I would not say I am an expert, but I am doing it for friends and family. Then, I thought: "I should offer this possibility to other students"
And here we are.
