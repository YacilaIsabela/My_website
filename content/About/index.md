##  Yacila I. Deza-Araujo, PhD.

My name is Yacila. I am from Cajamarca, a lovely city in the Peruvian Andes. I am currently post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Before this, I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at the Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden, Germany thanks to a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

Here, I would like to offer you what we could not find: a clear and realistic assessment and mentoring to increase the chances of the younger generations to get high academic education. Because of our background, we offer especial support to Latin-American students, but everyone is welcome. We can help you to tailor your motivation letter, CV and give you some tips that worked for us in our academic lives. 
And here we are.




##  Mariana Diaz Smoje, PhD.

Mariana will support us with applications for molecular biology and genetics.
