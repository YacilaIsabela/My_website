As a neuroscientist, I have special interest in supporting the education in brain sciences.
Here, you will find the latest academic positions and opportunities in the field of the neurosciences


[**Postdoctoral position in cerebellar imaging**](http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/open_postdoc.htm) in the Brain and Mind Institute at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. The review of applications will begin December 18th, 2020 and continue until position is filled.

**Postdoctoral position on Network Neuroscience at EPFL, Switzerland** [Mapping the higher-order dynamics of neurodegeneration in human brain networks](https://miplab.epfl.ch/application/files/3816/0561/7216/COST_PostDoc_Opening.pdf). The call will close on ​December 15th​.

**Two fully funded PhD– and postdoc positions in cognitive neuroscience are available in our Max Planck research group – located at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute in Frankfurt, Germany**. We want to build a collaborative environment to study the intersection between perception, cognition, and action in the brain [more](https://www.rademakerlab.com/job-add). A first round of online interviews will be scheduled for the middle of December 2020.

[**2 Postdoc positions in Integrative Neuroscience**](https://health.au.dk/en/about-health/vacant-positions/job/postdoc-in-integrative-neuroscience/) in Aarhus University, Denmark. To study Complex perception and behaviour are underpinned by multiple parallel and interacting neural processes. How can we effectively relate the brain dynamics of stimulus processing to individual behavioural or clinical traits?
