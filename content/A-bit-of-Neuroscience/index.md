As a neuroscientist, I have special interest in supporting the education in brain sciences.
Here, you will find the latest academic positions and opportunities in the field of neuroscience

Postdoctoral researcher in ultra-high field MRI. As a full-time MR physicist, you will join a dedicated research team that will be developing new acquisition/reconstruction/processing methodologies for the 7T MRI. Topics of interest may include coil design and optimization, sequence development, ultrahigh-resolution imaging (e.g., laminar fMRI), brain and spinal-cord imaging, advanced applications in cognitive and clinical neurosciences. Please send your CV, two references and a motivation letter to Dimitri.VanDeVille@epfl.ch
