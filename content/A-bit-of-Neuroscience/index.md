As a neuroscientist, I have special interest in supporting the education in brain sciences.
Here, you will find the latest academic positions and opportunities in the field of neuroscience

[*Junior Research Group Leader (100%, E 14 TV-L 1) or Postdoctoral Research Fellow (100%, E 13 TV-L 1) on Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience for 3 years (+ possible 2 year extension) (m/f/d)*](https://uni-tuebingen.de/universitaet/stellenangebote/newsfullview-stellenangebote/article/junior-research-group-leader-100-e-14-tv-l-or-postdoctoral-research-fellow-100-e-13-tv-l-on-cognitive-and-affective-neuroscience-m-f-d/). Initial deadline is September 30, 2021 but we continue to seek candidates until the position is filled by highly qualified candidates (i.e. late application is acceptable until we make a final decision). 

[*An exciting postdoc position is available within the central lab of Prof. Dr. Nikolaos Koutsouleris at LMU in Munich*](https://www.stepstone.de/stellenangebote--Postdoc-m-w-d-in-der-Biomarkerevaluation-zur-Unterstuetzung-der-klinischen-Translation-fuer-Schizophrenie-Muenchen-Klinikum-der-Universitaet-Muenchen--7374088-inline.html?cid=B2C_CLC_SYS8_Listing). This position aims to build and translate machine learning tools into clinical practice, specifically focussing on psychosis risk syndromes on a new project. It will involve the integration of multiple datatypes, especially multi-OMICS data. Good communication skills in written and spoken German are required. The position is for one year with the possibility of extension.

[*Applications are invited for a 3-4 year PhD fellowship available at the Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Norway*](https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/195915/phd-research-fellow). The successful applicant will join the lab of Prof. Sascha Fr√ºhholz, which is part of the Section for Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience. Our lab studies the neural foundations of emotional processing from various social and environmental signals using a variety of neuroscientific methods (fMRI, EEG, intracranial recordings, psychoacoustic experiments, etc.)
