The Moral & Social Brain Lab in Ghent, Belgium is recruiting a [*Ph.D. Student or a Postdoctoral researcher under the conditions of international mobility*](https://moralsocialbrain.com/current-vacancies/). The successful applicant will work on a project that aims to uncover the neuro-cognitive processes that prevent an individual from being coerced into causing pain to others. The applicant will use a novel experimental approach, which is an actualized and ethical version of the famous Stanley Milgram’s studies, to answer this question. The applicant will use behavioral, electrophysiology, neuromodulation and neuroimaging measurements. The general goal will be to understand why some individuals are more likely to stand up against immoral orders than others


Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany is recruiting a [*Postdoctoral Researcher
in the field of cognitive neurosciences (m/f/d)*](https://www4.uni-jena.de/Universität/Stellenmarkt/Wissenschaftliche+Beschäftigte/Wissenschaftliche_r+Mitarbeiter_in+%28PostDoc%29+im+Bereich+der+neurokognitiven+Wissenschaft+%28m_w_d%29.html). The Department of Biological Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience (BPCN) is primarily concerned with processes of visual perception. Both basic neuronal mechanisms of visual perception, e.g. phenomena such as repetition suppression and their explanatory approaches, and specific perceptual processes, as in the case of human faces, are investigated. For this purpose, we perform TMS, EEG, fMRI or behavioural experiments. Application should be submitted by email (one PDF file), stating the vacancy ID 370/2021 by 30.11.2021 to: gyula.kovacs@uni-jena.de
