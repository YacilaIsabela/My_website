We are offering a [*3-year postdoctoral position linked to the Neuroimaging group*](https://www.barcelonabeta.org/en/bbrc-research-center/job-offers/post-doctoral-position-neuroimaging-research-group). The Neuroimaging Research Group focuses on the study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to reveal brain characteristics related to healthy aging and AD risk factors that can be suggestive of novel prevention strategies. For this purpose, neuroimaging data is analysed together with cognition, genetics, biomarker and other clinical, environmental and lifestyle factors in order to detect their impact on the brain at the structural, functional and molecular levels. Send your complete application (motivation letter, CV and contact details of 3 referees) to rh@barcelonabeta.org. Deadline: 30.12.2021
