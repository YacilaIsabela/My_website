Como neurocient&iacute;fica, tengo especial inter&eacute;s en apoyar la educaci&oacute;n en ciencias del cerebro. 
Ac&aacute; les ofrezco las &uacute;ltimas oportunidades acad&eacute;micas en neurociencias.

S&oacute;lo en ingl&eacute;s

We are offering a [*3-year postdoctoral position linked to the Neuroimaging group*](https://www.barcelonabeta.org/en/bbrc-research-center/job-offers/post-doctoral-position-neuroimaging-research-group). The Neuroimaging Research Group focuses on the study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to reveal brain characteristics related to healthy aging and AD risk factors that can be suggestive of novel prevention strategies. For this purpose, neuroimaging data is analysed together with cognition, genetics, biomarker and other clinical, environmental and lifestyle factors in order to detect their impact on the brain at the structural, functional and molecular levels. Send your complete application (motivation letter, CV and contact details of 3 referees) to rh@barcelonabeta.org. Deadline: 30.12.2021

Applications are invited for a [*postdoctoral position to study social decision making using fMRI in healthy subjects and intracranial recordings in patients with epilepsy*](https://dreherteam.wixsite.com/neuroeconomics/job). This job is available immediately, for 2 or 3 years. Salary will be commensurate with experience and qualifications according to CNRS scales. Candidates should send their CV, statement of research interests, representative publications, and contact information of two references to Jean-Claude Dreher, email: dreher@isc.cnrs.fr. 

The Moral & Social Brain Lab in Ghent, Belgium is recruiting a [*Ph.D. Student or a Postdoctoral researcher under the conditions of international mobility*](https://moralsocialbrain.com/current-vacancies/). The successful applicant will work on a project that aims to uncover the neuro-cognitive processes that prevent an individual from being coerced into causing pain to others. The applicant will use a novel experimental approach, which is an actualized and ethical version of the famous Stanley Milgram’s studies, to answer this question. The applicant will use behavioral, electrophysiology, neuromodulation and neuroimaging measurements. The general goal will be to understand why some individuals are more likely to stand up against immoral orders than others

Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany is recruiting a [*Postdoctoral Researcher
in the field of cognitive neurosciences (m/f/d)*](https://www4.uni-jena.de/Universität/Stellenmarkt/Wissenschaftliche+Beschäftigte/Wissenschaftliche_r+Mitarbeiter_in+%28PostDoc%29+im+Bereich+der+neurokognitiven+Wissenschaft+%28m_w_d%29.html). The Department of Biological Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience (BPCN) is primarily concerned with processes of visual perception. Both basic neuronal mechanisms of visual perception, e.g. phenomena such as repetition suppression and their explanatory approaches, and specific perceptual processes, as in the case of human faces, are investigated. For this purpose, we perform TMS, EEG, fMRI or behavioural experiments. Application should be submitted by email (one PDF file), stating the vacancy ID 370/2021 by 30.11.2021 to: gyula.kovacs@uni-jena.de
